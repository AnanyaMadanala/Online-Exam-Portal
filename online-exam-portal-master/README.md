   - Integrated authentication and role-based authorization.  

4. **Testing**  
   - Conducted **unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing**.  
   - Ensured proper validation and error handling in exam modules.  

5. **Deployment**  
   - Deployed on **cloud platforms** (AWS / Render / Netlify / Vercel).  
   - Configured CI/CD pipelines for smooth updates.  

6. **Maintenance**
